# forward-euler-method-single-eqn
This is a python program to solve and plot a simple differential equation using the forward Euler method. In this example, I solved the nuclear decay equation-

m_t = m_0 e^(-lambda * t)

where-
* m_0 = initial mass,
* m_t = mass at time t,
* lambda = decay constant = ln|2| / half-life

In this example, the sample was taken to have 1 kg initial mass, a half-life of 100 seconds, and the system was solved up to 1000 seconds.
